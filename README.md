- median pass
- time of possession/#of rush
- completion percentage * (passes >7 yards)
- interception scaled by yard line
- fumble scaled by yard line
- big plays (run, pass, ko, punt)
- redzone efficiency (possibly multiplied by everything)
- defense - average punt distance, average field position start
- prob of punt = (#incompletions + tfl - median rush - median pass) / b

- average completion streak
- turnovers - scaled
- redzone percentage
- redzone completion percentage
- win differential
- median rush yards inside 20
- number of plays
